### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Muhammed Can KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼kaslan.  

I'm a CS (& Math with Double Major Program) graduate from Bilkent University (Ankara, Turkey).

Iâ€™m particularly interested in doing "engineering", that is to say building reliable systems that use resources as efficiently as possible.
This aligns with the main goals of fields like Backend Engineering, Big Data Engineering (?), Parallel Computing, Distributed Systems etc.  
So, these are the fields I would be (and am ?) enjoying working in.

You may visit my personal website which exist for its own sake at [kucukaslan.com.tr](https://kucukaslan.com.tr) and take a look at my [cv.pdf](https://kucukaslan.com.tr/cv.pdf).

See some of the projects I contributed below:

For the record, dear stalker, I'm aware of the fancy elements to display here, but am not a fan of them. 

Nevertheless, I think https://gprm.itsvg.in/ is a nice tool to create such fancy READMEs if you do like.
